Make the code better using following pointers.  Don't limit to the following only.

- *Function encapsulation*: Consider breaking the code into smaller functions, each with a specific task, such as loading data, preprocessing, and analyzing the data. This will improve code readability and make it easier to maintain and debug.
- *Variable naming*: Use more descriptive variable names to make the code more understandable. For instance, instead of using name, you could use column_index or similar.
- *Add comments and documentation*: Include comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of specific lines or sections. Also, add docstrings to the functions to describe their functionality, inputs, and outputs.
- *Error handling*: Add error handling to manage cases where the input file may not exist or may have an unsupported format.
- *Column iteration*: Instead of iterating through column names and indexing columns using these names, you can use the iteritems() method to iterate through the columns and their names directly. This way, you can avoid using an additional variable (like name) to keep track of the column number.
- *Report generation*: Consider saving the analysis results to a file or creating a more structured output format to make it easier to read and process.
- *User input*: Add command-line options or a simple user interface to allow users to specify the input file and any other configuration options.
- *Progress feedback*: If the spreadsheet is large, it might be helpful to provide some feedback on the progress of the analysis, like printing the current column number or using a progress bar library.
- *Extensibility*: Consider making the code more modular and extensible, so that new analysis methods can be added easily without changing the core code.`
