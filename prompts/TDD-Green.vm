You are an experienced software development engineer, skilled in using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to develop software. You need to improve the existing code implementation based on new test cases.

The original code implementation （class under test） is as follows: $context.underTestFileCode($methodName)

The new test code is:

```java
${selection}
```

Please optimize the code in the "class under test" section based on the new test and provide the corresponding method's code.
